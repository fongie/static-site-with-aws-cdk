# Hi! I'm Max

Formerly a national team coach in fencing, an archaeologist, and a street-busking harmonica-player, I am now a software enginner who is currently head of backend and cloud infrastructure development at [Alex Therapeutics](https://www.alextherapeutics.com): a startup in digital therapeutics which develops software medical devices that help improve mental health.

When I learn about interesting software development things, I will write about it here if I have time for it.

If you wish to get in contact with me, you can check out the social icons on the [front](../index.html), or email me at mkorlinge@gmail.com.
